Code for GBS and analysis of Kodo, Proso, and Little millets from Johnson et al 2019, Genome-wide Population Structure Analyses of Three Minor Millets

These scripts are for parsing the raw Illumina sequence data from Johnson et al 2019 into SNP calls using the TASSEL GBSv2 pipeline (https://bitbucket.org/tasseladmin/tassel-5-source/wiki/Tassel5GBSv2Pipeline). Keyfiles for each species are provided.

These scripts were last tested with TASSEL 5.2.43 and Python 3.5.2
